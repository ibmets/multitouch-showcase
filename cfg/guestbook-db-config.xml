    This file contains the settings for the database that holds
    information about guests. The database should have table
    called 'users' that has fields user_group(varchar), first_name(varchar),
    last_name(varchar), company(varchar), id(int) and title(varchar).
    The id is the integer that is tied to the guest's marker.
